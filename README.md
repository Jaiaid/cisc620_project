Another way to do stuff
For four table takes around 60min, can be reduced (I think around to 30-40min) by doing all stuff in one function (files will be read once)

Required package:

pip install psycopg

To run
```python3 db_database_prepare.py```

System Description
Intel Xeon 2.4GHz
31GB
1TB SSD

Probably should reduce insertion batch size
